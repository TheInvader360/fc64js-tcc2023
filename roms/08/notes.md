The first challenge is to get an animated tentacle effect on the screen! Use a for loop to create multiple circles, rotate them and apply the pixel effect to create the tentacles!

You can check out our [Day 8 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xvtpi0HJ44A) for an overview on this type of effect.

The second challenge is to keep your effect at a maximum of 256 characters. Experiment with some of the palettes from the Bytebattle page on sizecoding.org!
