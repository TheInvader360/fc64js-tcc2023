The first challenge is to create a voxel christmas tree that rotates around the y-axis, What other effects can you add? Landscape? Snow?

You can check out our [Day 12 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXMN1Q2z-MI) above for an overview of the challenge, but there’s no code samples today! If you’ve made it this far, you possess the knowledge within you!

The second challenge is to keep your effect at a maximum of 256 BYTES! We are on to the compressed file formats now so lets see how many extra bytes we can squeeze in!
