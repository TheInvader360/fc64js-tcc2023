The first challenge is to get an animated tunnel effect on the screen! Use two for loops to address every pixel, and use the polar coordinates to set the colour!

You can check out our [Day 5 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkTebg0gNNU) for an overview on this type of effect.

The second challenge is to keep your effect at a maximum of 256 characters. You should have plenty of room to play around and come up with an awesome effect, but you can always try for 128 if you need a bit more of a challenge!
