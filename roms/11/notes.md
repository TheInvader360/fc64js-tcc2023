The first challenge is to create a voxel cube that rotates around two axes, the voxel cube must have an additional effect incorporated. This can be an effect like coloring the voxels or it can be a movement effect.

You can check out our [Day 11 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K68NwsLGAPc) for an overview on this structure, the code mentioned in the video is [here](https://tcc.lovebyte.party/day11/#sample-code-for-tic-80).

The second challenge is to keep your effect at a maximum of 256 BYTES! We are on to the compressed file formats now so lets see how many extra bytes we can squeeze in!
