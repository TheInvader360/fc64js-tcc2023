The first challenge is to get a basic animated per-pixel plasma effect on the screen! Use two for loops to address every pixel, and set the colour based a combination of sin() values!

You can check out our [Day 4 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=263vUVFX3F8) for an overview on this type of effect.

The second challenge is to keep your effect at a maximum of 128 characters. If you’re coming up against the character limit in PICO-8 using a custom palette you can choose not to include the palette in today’s challenge character count.
