The first challenge is to get an animated shadebob effect on the screen! Use sin and cos to create an animated shadebob, youâ€™ll have to do the additive bit yourself!

You can check out our [Day 9 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYH_ZErT1-0) for an overview on this type of effect.

The second challenge is to keep your effect at a maximum of 256 characters. For TIC-80 experiment with some of the palettes from the Bytebattle page on sizecoding.org!
