The first challenge is to get an animated shadebob effect on the screen! Use sin and cos to create an animated shadebob, youâ€™ll have to do the additive bit yourself!

You can check out our [Day 9 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYH_ZErT1-0) for an overview on this type of effect.

The second challenge is to keep your effect at a maximum of 256 characters. For TIC-80 experiment with some of the palettes from the Bytebattle page on sizecoding.org!

The effect will eventually run it's course so it would be nice to keep restarting after running for a certain amount of time.

```js
romPalette = [0x464678, 0x9a6390, 0xe67595, 0xff8b6f, 0xffa936, 0xffc247, 0xffd647, 0xffff78]; // https://lospec.com/palette-list/sunset-8

let timer = 0;

function romInit() {}

function romLoop() {
  timer += 0.01;

  for (let i = -1; i < 2; i++) {
    for (let j = -1; j < 2; j++) {
      const x = 32 + Math.cos(7 * timer) * 32;
      const y = 32 + Math.sin(6 * timer) * 32;
      const existingColor = getPixel(x, y);
      let newColor = existingColor;
      if (existingColor < 7) {
        newColor++;
      }
      drawPixel(x + i, y + j, newColor);
    }
  }

  if (timer > 32) {
    clearGfx();
    timer = 0;
  }
}
```

Sizecoding:

```js
let a,b,i,j,t=0,x,y;function tic(){t+=.01;for(i=-1;i<2;i++)for(j=-1;j<2;j++){x=32+Math.cos(7*t)*32;y=32+Math.sin(6*t)*32;a=gpx(x,y);b=a++;if(a<7)b++,pix(x+i,y+j,b)}if(t>32)cls(),t=0} // 182 bytes
```

Replacing the five instances of `32` with e.g. `,s=32` and five instances of `s` offers no benefit

Replacing the two instances of `Math.` with `,m=Math` and two instances of `m.` costs an extra byte

`peek`ing and `poke`ing is way costlier than `gpx`ing and `pix`ing, even before rounding and guarding against out of bounds calls...

I'm happy with 182 bytes :)
