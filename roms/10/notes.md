The first challenge is to set up multiple effects that cycle based on the time. Include at least 2 different effects, these can be new or they can be from previous days.

You can check out our [Day 10 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmmgEJOVg_s) for an overview on this structure.

The second challenge is to keep your effect at a maximum of 256 BYTES! We are on to the compressed file formats now so lets see how many extra bytes we can squeeze in!
