The first challenge is to combine some of the techniques you have learned over the week into an effect! Playing around with mixing different effects is a great way to spark creativity! You could combine your Day 2 scene with a scroller to create an animated Christmas Card or go hard and great a xor-plasma-tunnel-scroller-christmas-tree!

Our [Day 7 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCus9KXBk68) is about general sizecoding tips and tricks that may help you, but itâ€™s not necessary so you can even start early!

The second challenge is to keep your effect at a maximum of 256 characters.
