The first challenge is to get an animated sine scroller effect on the screen! Use a for loop to cycle through each character and animate its height with a sin value!

You can check out our [Day 6 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUOlRYzs4_s) for an overview on this type of effect.

The second challenge is to keep your effect at a maximum of 256 characters. You should have plenty of room to play around with adding a background effect also, but you can always try for 128 if you need a bit more of a challenge!
