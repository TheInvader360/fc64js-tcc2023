The first challenge is to get a basic animated per-pixel effect on the screen!

Use two for loops to address every pixel, and set the color based on the x or y location, this should give you a nice gradient in TIC-80, and something a little less smooth in PICO-8 unless you rearrange the palette. Add in a time value so that your effect is animated! You can animate the color, position, scale, or anything else you can think of. Tomorrow we’ll be extending this to create a classic plasma effect. You don’t have to match the example perfectly, it’s just a basic example of one possible effect.

You can take a look at our [Day 3 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPMDLlxB6Lw) for an overview on this type of effect.

The second challenge is to keep your effect at a maximum of 128 characters! Half the amount we used on the previous challenges! On the PICO-8 this may be more difficult to do with a custom palette, so for this challenge you can choose not to include the palette in your character count.

Achieved a pretty cool effect in 108 bytes (same ```uncounted.js``` caveat as before)
